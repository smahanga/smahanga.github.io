    <h1>Enterprise Procurement Integration for Fortune 500 Company Client</h1>
    <p><em>Role: Product-minded Senior Application Development Analyst 
      ‚Ä¢ Project was split in two phases . Phase1: Migrating Master Data (Supplier, Currency) to 3rd party System and validate
      . Phase2 Build Outbound and Inbound Integrations from and to Oracle ERP for transactional data (Reqs, Po, Invoice, Payments)
      . Duration for each phase : 8‚Äì9 months 
      ‚Ä¢ Stack: Oracle R12, PL/SQL, Python, REST APIs, Middleware</em></p>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Planned, designed, and implemented API-based data flows for <strong>Supplier</strong>, <strong>Requisition</strong>,
        <strong>Purchase Order (PO)</strong>, <strong>Invoice</strong>, and <strong>Payment</strong> modules. Objective:
        enable seamless, secure transfer of master & transactional data across ERP, procurement, and finance systems‚Äî
        improving procurement efficiency and reducing reconciliation effort.
      </p>

      <p>
Designed API contracts and data models, working with business analysts to ensure mappings followed company policies, tax rules, and approval workflows.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Owned <strong>field-level data mapping</strong> across Oracle R12 ‚áÑ Procurement ‚áÑ Payments (supplier terms, tax codes, cost centers, PO/Invoice totals).</li>
        <li>Worked with <strong>middleware engineers</strong> on transformation rules, idempotency keys, and versioning.</li>
        <li>Defined <strong>error standards</strong> (retry/backoff, correlation IDs) and <strong>security</strong> (,least-privilege roles).</li>
        <li>Reviewed <strong>OpenAPI specs</strong>, sequence diagrams, and mapping workbooks with stakeholders for sign-off.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Build & Execution -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Phase 3 ‚Äî Build & Execution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Iterative delivery by module: start with <strong>Supplier</strong> (lower blast radius)in Phase1 migration, then <strong>Req ‚Üí PO ‚Üí Invoice ‚Üí Payment</strong>.</li>
        <li>Implemented <strong>PL/SQL</strong> packages (Oracle operations) and validation using Excel and <strong>Python</strong> script.</li>
        <li>Daily touchpoints with <strong>business team</strong> for timely clarifications on feasibility & rule changes.</li>
        <li>Joint <strong>code reviews</strong> and <strong>dry-runs</strong> with middleware to stabilize contracts and auth flows.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Testing & Data Verification -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Phase 4 ‚Äî Testing & Data Verification</h2>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Success depended on more than APIs: it required <strong>constant collaboration</strong> with the business for timely inputs,
        tight partnership with <strong>middleware</strong> on transformations and reliability, and a relentless focus on
        <strong>data verification</strong>‚Äîespecially PO/Invoice/Payment amount parity. This blend of product thinking, delivery
        orchestration, and engineering discipline created durable, measurable impact.
